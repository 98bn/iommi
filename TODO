- field_choices param to Column
    is a short form to change:
        b = Column(show=False, filter_field=forms.ChoiceField(choices=[('', '')] + [(x.pk, x) for x in Foo.objects.all()[:10]]))
    into
        b = Column(show=False, filter_choices=Foo.objects.all())
- attr param to column
    used to get the value of a cell. Default is to use the 'name' field like it is now. Useful for multiple columns that display one
    column formatted in different ways.
- When leaving out "filter=False" on a field that can't be filtered by django the error message is not helpful
- bulk=True exception:
    TypeError at /transactions/
    can only concatenate list (not "ModelChoiceIterator") to list
        •                         field.choices = [('', '')] + field.choices ...

- bulk_field param to Column just like filter_field (in mammon it would otherwise give you the option to choose all categories of all users, not just the current user)
- bulk_choices param just like filter_choices
- css/scss should be in the egg
- in mammon the “description” bulk edit is actually an “append to description”. How do we handle that?
= we should document our standard practice of defining your own Column with added shortcuts, this is a handy thing to do

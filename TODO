- Column(attr='...') should work even with filter, sort and bulk
- When leaving out "filter=False" on a field that can't be filtered by django the error message is not helpful
- in mammon the "description" bulk edit is actually an "append to description". How do we handle that?
- we should document our standard practice of defining your own Column with added shortcuts, this is a handy thing to do
- scss/css in egg
- i18n for the text (basically should just be the titles of the filter and bulk edit buttons)
- Column.number doesn't set rj on header
- Column.icon should have an option to not set fa-lg, it's currently hard coded

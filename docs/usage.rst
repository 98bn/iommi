Usage
=====

You need to add `tri.tables` to installed apps or copy the templates to your own template directory.

Other than that it should just be to `from tri.tables import Table, Column` and off you go.

Styling
-------

There is a `table.scss` file included with the project that provides a default styling for the table if you want a fast and easy starting point for styling.
